Thesis Source Code

This is the source code used in John Fenske's thesis "Quality Measures for Lightfield Interpolation Algorithms." The code is written for MATLAB, but has not been tested and any use is as-is. The following directories have been added:
render_GUI: original code for lightfield capture GUI, interpolation methods, comparison of quality measures, and other functions.
flow: Brox's optical flow algorithm
Offscreen_v2: openGL libs to capture depth maps
patcht: wrapper to show textures on MATLAB patch objects
SSIM: Wang and Bovik's SSIM code
read_wobj and write_wobj: interacting with wavefront .obj files
